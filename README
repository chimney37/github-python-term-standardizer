The purpose of the project is to scrape wikipedia using a set of keywords to get their canonical form. For example. The primary relationship we want to scrape is ja <=> en. Therefore the input can either be Japanese or English. If a search result exist on wikipedia, we get the top ranked result, by fetching the page of the search result. Note: this software is dependent on wikipedia API for python.


Installation:

    1) install python >= 2.6
    2) get wikipedia API for python >= 1.4.0
        pip install wikipedia

Running the software:

    python main.py --batch <path-to-input-file> --out <path-to-output-file>

Input file format (TSV) Per row:

    <Input Keyword>
    Note: Multiple rows of keywords in Japanese or English

Output file format (TSV) Per row:

    <Input Keyword><tab><Output Keyword><tab>Summary
    Note: Summary refers to the page summary of the wiki article, specified by the output keyword (title of wiki page)

TODO:

    Try to use a more versatile wiki scraping API, to get the translation equivalent of ja => en and en => ja rather than relying it on a single language setting and getting page based on its title.


Changelog:
